<blockquote>YtGo is a Windows aplication developed in the Go Programming Language that enables you to download youtube videos locally</blockquote>

<br>

## ðŸ§¶ Downloading and Using YtGo
You can download the Windows executable YtGo file from this **[Google Drive Repository](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UfglHclG5ORWKIgLp4frexwr5n_skKyj/view?usp=sharing "Google Drive Repository")**

After the **ytgo.exe** file is downloaded, all you have to do is run it, and a console window should appear, ready to download any inputed youtube URLs.

<blockquote>The downloaded files will be saved to the directory <b>ytgo.exe</b> file is.</blockquote>
